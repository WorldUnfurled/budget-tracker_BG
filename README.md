## Description

A progressive web app (PWA) that allows users to view and save budget records whether on or offline.

## Installing

The npm packages used for this are as follows:

* *Express*: for the server
* *Mongoose*: for the mongoDB schema and connection
* *Morgan*: logger middleware
* *Compression*: to compress files
* *Webpack*: to bundle files

Use `npm i` to install all of them at once.

## Usage

Upon entering the site, you as a user will have can add a new transaction to your budget. Funds can either be added or subtracted with the corresponding buttons. A graph will display tracking your budget. Data can still be entered into the app when the user goes offline, and it will persist just like any other online addition.
